I am a young, self-motivated, determined individual who strives to achieve. I enjoy meeting new people and I strive to experience everything the world has to offer. I enjoy the sense of achievement gained from meeting targets and completing projects by applying my skills and passion to whatever challenges I face. I love pushing myself out of my comfort zone and learning new skills.

<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>
I have a great deal of technical skills, mostly acquired through years of passion for electronics, programming and IT. This passion formed when I was a child and has continued throughout my adulthood. I ensure all of my skills are kept up to date and relevant to current standards and guarantee that, where necessary, references to the necessary documentation are always used. As I have such an in-depth understanding of IT, I pick up new skills and methods with ease and am always keen to learn more.

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
I have excellent soldering skills, having learned to solder around the age of ten, when I first started my journey into the world of electronics. Since then, I have also learned to solder SMT components by hand. I am more than comfortable testing with multimeters, oscilloscopes and logic analysers and always use the correct tool for the job. My troubleshooting skills are excellent, having designed and built my own electronic devices from the ground up, I am able to troubleshoot modular systems with ease. As I am a very logical thinker, I find fault finding and problem solving easy and am quick to think of methods to repair things.
</p>
<p>
I am very familiar with a products development lifecycle, and as such, understand that there will always be faults and challenges. I am comfortable disassembling and reassembling circuits in order to find bugs, employing an open mind and out of the box thinking where necessary. Throughout my personal projects, I have designed with USB, RS-232, RS-485, Ethernet, DMX-512, UART, I2C, SPI and MIDI protocols among others. I am no stranger to technical specifications and find them an invaluable resource for keeping up with the rapidly evolving industry.

    <h2>Microcontrollers</h2>
<p>
Development with microcontrollers has been a hobby for me since the age of thirteen, when I was given a Microchip PIC development kit by my older brother. Since then, I have designed with a wide variety of Microchip PICs, Cypress PSoCs and other microcontrollers, developing in both C and assembly.

    <h2>PCBs</h2>
  <p>
I have excellent PCB design skills and am no stranger to Cadsoft's EAGLE PCB and Diptrace PCB design software for schematic and board design. I have even gone as far as manufacturing my own surface-mount PCBs at home, using the toner transfer method and UV exposure methods. Populating PCBs with components and following schematics and datasheets is no challenge for me.

    <h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>
I have an excellent understanding of how the internet operates and I am no stranger to the development process associated with designing websites and web applications. I am well versed with client side technologies including HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I have recently become accustomed with the jQuery framework and it has revolutionised the way I think about Javascript. My web development skills are not limited to client-side technologies either, as I have an in depth understanding of server-side programming as well and am comfortable working with PHP, MySQL and Node.JS among others.

    <h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
  My programming skills are not limited to web applications, having written programs for PCs on both windows and OSX/Unix in C, C++, java and Qt. Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Unde, nemo?. I have recently taken to using git for version tracking my code and believe it is an invaluable tool for a reliable development process. It goes without saying that I have years of experience with both Microsoft Windows and Unix based operating systems (OSX, Mint, Ubuntu etc.) and my talent does not end with programming.

I am confident in my ability to apply my learning skills to any new task and improve my current abilities. I have excellent organisational skills and am always punctual. I am not afraid of hard work and am always determined to meet targets and deadlines without fail. I use my initiative where necessary and always follow company policies and procedures.

  <h2>2012 - Stow College</h2>
  <p>
With a great enthusiasm for electronics and IT, I decided to enrol at stow college. This meant moving away from home. This was an important decision for me and it challenged me to leave my comfort zone and start anew in a city I was not familiar with. This has been one of the biggest decisions of my life and has been part of a constant drive of self-improvement. During my time at Stow college, I consistently passed all class tests. I gained an appreciation for teamwork and presentation. I learned the importance of understanding the theory behind the operation of many electronic components and systems. As many of my classmates did not have the knowledge I have gained from learning about electronics as a hobby, I was often the first point of call for assistance for many of my peers. I was awarded an A for my second-year graded project.

I spend a lot of my free time learning new skills and trying out new technologies. I am fascinated by the world of tech and programming and it really is my life, not just my career. I spend a lot of my free time working on my own projects, programming, designing electronics and pushing my skills to the limit in all areas. I love making electronic music on FL Studio/Ableton and going out to see acts live. I enjoy walking and meeting up with friends.
