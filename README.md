# RAM-CV-2013

This is a web-based CV I made in 2013.

## Running it

Simply download the assets and launch `index.html`.

## About
It was inspired by the firefox web page that used the parallax effect. I had never seen
anythng like that before then and thought I would try and do something similar.

The only dependencies are bootstrap and jQuery, which are both in the folder.
Things were much more simple back then.

If it looks a bit weird, you'll have to trust me it looks _great_
...on a Mid-2012 15" Macbook Pro Retina in Chrome, obviously! :D

I have removed contact details and things that made me cringe a bit _too_ much.
